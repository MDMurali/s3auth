Architecture of s3auth.com

  The system consists of three modules:

   * <<<s3auth-hosts>>> is responsible for data persistence, downloading
     of S3 data objects on demand, and authorization of users through
     <<<.htpasswd>>> mechanism;

   * <<<s3auth-rest>>> is a web front-end that enables manipulation with
     configuration data and user authentication

   * <<<s3auth-relay>>> is a custom HTTP web server that sends HTTP requests
     through to <<<s3auth-hosts>>>.

  High-level packages diagram explains how these modules depends on each other:

  <<<s3auth-hosts>>> exposes a number of interfaces and just one class
  {{{./s3auth-hosts/apidocs/com/s3auth/hosts/DynamoHosts.html}<<<DynamoHosts>>>}},
  which implements {{{./s3auth-hosts/apidocs/com/s3auth/hosts/Hosts.html}<<<Hosts>>>}}
  interface. As the name explains, we persist user data in Amazon DynamoDB.

  <<<s3auth-rest>>> is a collection of JAX-RS resources, JAXB-annotated
  entities, XSL pages, Groovy end-to-end tests
  - all managed by Jetty web server, enhanced with
  {{{http://www.rexsl.com/}ReXSL framework}}. The only class it uses is
  {{{./s3auth-hosts/apidocs/com/s3auth/hosts/DynamoHosts.html}<<<DynamoHosts>>>}},
  which it instantiates inside a servlet listener.

  <<<s3auth-relay>>> is a custom multi-threaded web server, runnable as a JAR from
  a command line. Again, it uses
  {{{./s3auth-hosts/apidocs/com/s3auth/hosts/DynamoHosts.html}<<<DynamoHosts>>>}}
  to get access to our persistence layer.
